      A big problem that I face while working on projects is that academics is a big hindrance, especially when my interests are not aligned with it. For example when there is an extra class on Saturday, even if it is for 1 hour, it ruins the whole day and I am not able to do anything then. I am not sure that I am being picky here or is it the same with others as well. So my questions:
      
      1. How did you manage such situations?
      2. Worst is interacting with profs when you haven't done tutorials / missed some classes. How was you experience in this regard?

      3. However, companies ignoring security reports is something I can never understand. Your first priority should be the security of your customers and you are doing them a great disservice by ignoring security reports.

    timestamp: 1457538420

      1. The only reason wallets are popular is because they bypass the RBI 2 factor guidelines
      2. RBI has managed to hold our economy pretty well. Their stance on 2 factor is understandable, even though it doesn't let SaaS companies mature in India at all. NPCI on the other hand is trying really nice things with UPI and IMPS and so on.  RBI is even doing a consultation on Card Acceptance Infrastructure currently: <https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/MDRDBEDA36AB77C4C81A3951C4679DAE68F.PDF>.
      3. There is a lot of regulation in the payments industry (which is kinda needed) that inhibits growth and experiments. However, the only authorities RBI grants this power to are banks, which are monolithic and slow and very risk-averse. However, a few banks like RBL are doing good stuff here. The regulations I'd want to attack are those that prohibit private players from doing [X] while allowing banks to do [X]. Opening a bank is next to impossible in India, and as such, you are left to tying up with banks and hoping you get decent terms.
      4. Wallets will hopefully die out over the next few years as we move to better payments infrastructure (things like UPI). They fragment the ecosystem and should not be allowed to flourish beyond a certain limit. Otherwise, you face the same risks as China, where a single private provider (AliPay) controls the majority of the online payments market. Contrast this to somewhere like US, where you have digital wallets, but no one uses them (like AMEX ezeclick) because the incentive for using them isn't high enough.

      Does the UPI offer this level of simplicity for small PoS like kirana shops? On the other side will banks support the required accounts when the kirana shop links his UPI or digital wallet to the bank? Or will they block it and demand some additional tax as well?

When I went to the bank because of some problems, they said what's a USSD?? and didn't really cooperate with me to understand the MPIN and IMPS funda."

      I can't say I am a fan of imps. I don't even want to maintain one mpin for each bank account I own. I like how ICICI allows you do transfer via neft/rtgs/imps just by using standard ifsc code and account no. We have all grown pretty accustomed to ifsc which are publicly available.
      
      Truthfully users shouldn't even be concerned about if he is using imps,neft or rtgs for most cases of course.

      IMPS has a limit of around 50k(or
      something) for most banks, NEFT/RTGS
      goes much higher.

      You’re right, do you know of any

      Its not about banks not wanting better
      technology, etc. The reasons are
      financial, it has do with liquidity
      reasons and the risk they are willing to
      undertake.

      When you transfer funds real time to
      another bank you(as a bank), need to
      have much higher liquidity than when you
      only transfer the net amount you have to
      transfer at the end of every hour or at
      the end of every day.

      There are chances that smaller banks
      might not be able to have the liquidity
      to transfer so much money and other
      banks want to minimize risks when
      dealing with such banks.
